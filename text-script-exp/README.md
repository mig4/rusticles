# text script experiment

I thought it would be fun to take an AWK/grep/column script I once constructed
to do some text manipulation and re-write it in [Rust][] ðŸ¦€ðŸ˜‚

## background

For a bit of background, this was after a project to split a number of
[Prometheus][] instances into shards, initially one-per-cluster being scraped. I
wanted to compare and see how much more memory is used in total in this setup.

The data was collected using a [fish-shell][] loop over [kubie][] executing a
kubectl [resource-capacity][] (plugin) command to collect resource usage data
from nodes and pods with label `app=prometheus`:

``` sh
for inst in $list_of_kube_contexts;
  echo "# $inst";
  kubie exec $inst monitoring \
    kubectl resource-capacity --pods --pod-labels=app=prometheus --util;
  or break;
end | tee prometheus.resource-capacity.util.txt
```

## script

[The script](./the-script.sh) uses an [AWK script](./the-script.awk), `grep`
and `column` to process memory requests, limits and utilisation data in
[this file](./tests/resources/prometheus.resource-capacity.util.txt), summarises
them and outputs totals that make it easy to compare resource usage between
monolithic instances of Prometheus (rows marked _old_) and multiple shards they
were split into (rows marked _new_). The output is stored in
[old-new-comparison file](./tests/resources/prometheus.resource-capacity.old-new-comparison.txt).

When ran [the script](./the-script.sh) will re-generate the output file in
`tests/resources/` directory.

## results

Rust tests in [apptest.rs](./tests/apptest.rs) verify that the Rust program
produces output equal to the output of the AWK script, i.e.
[this](./tests/resources/prometheus.resource-capacity.old-new-comparison.txt)
(ran with `cargo test`).

The initial implementation in [main.rs](./src/main.rs) works and passes the
tests ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¦€ðŸ•º

Future improvements would be nice in code parsing the input to make it more
robust especially wrt memory units output by kubectl, etc.
